# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. It serves as a practical reference and learning resource for understanding fundamental computer science concepts.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

1. **Arrays**
   - Basic array operations
   - Push, pop, shift, unshift methods
   - Array manipulation examples

2. **Linked Lists**
   - Node class implementation
   - LinkedList class with append and print methods
   - Basic linked list operations

3. **Stacks**
   - Stack implementation using arrays
   - Push, pop, peek operations
   - Stack overflow/underflow handling

4. **Queues**
   - Queue implementation using arrays
   - Enqueue, dequeue, front operations
   - Queue overflow/underflow handling

5. **Binary Search Trees**
   - TreeNode class implementation
   - BST operations (insert, contains)
   - Tree traversal capabilities

6. **Graphs**
   - Graph implementation using adjacency lists
   - Vertex and edge operations
   - Basic graph manipulation

7. **Hash Tables**
   - Hash table implementation with collision handling
   - Set and get operations
   - Custom hash function

8. **Min Heaps**
   - Min heap implementation
   - Insert and extract operations
   - Heapify up and down operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (any recent version)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-algos.git
cd dsa-algos
```

2. Run the examples:
```bash
node dsa-structures.js
```

## Usage Examples

Each data structure includes practical examples demonstrating its basic operations. The code is well-commented and includes console.log statements to show the output of various operations.
